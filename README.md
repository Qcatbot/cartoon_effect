# cartoon_effect
This repo shows how to apply cartoon effect to all the images in a folder &amp; make a cartoon type movie out of it. 

# Description
The video for this work has taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ouht1xip9NQ.
A small python script was written to get the frames out of the clips.
Then for each frames, average filtering, gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding were applied.
Finally took two images & blend them together.
